# ai201-project3-takemeter# TakeMeter

A fine-tuned text classifier that evaluates discourse quality in r/soccer, Reddit's largest football community. TakeMeter classifies comments into four categories — Analysis, Prediction, Reaction, and Humor — and compares a fine-tuned DistilBERT model against a zero-shot Groq baseline.

---

## Community

**r/soccer** — one of Reddit's largest sports communities, covering leagues, tournaments, players, tactics, and match results worldwide. The community is a strong fit for classification because a single thread contains tactically reasoned comments, match predictions, emotional reactions, and jokes — meaningful distinctions recognizable to regular members.

## Labels

| Label | Definition |
|---|---|
| **analysis** | Evaluates players, teams, tactics, or matches using reasoning, evidence, or football knowledge. Includes subjective judgments if supported by observation or argument. |
| **prediction** | Forecasts a future outcome or discusses a hypothetical scenario. Includes all forecasts, even if emotional or speculative. |
| **reaction** | Expresses pure emotion, excitement, or personal feeling with no claim being made. Also covers bare assertions about a player or team made without supporting reasoning. |
| **humor** | Primary purpose is humor, sarcasm, a joke, or meme reference. If it asserts a football outcome, it is NOT humor even if sarcastic. |

## Dataset

- **Source:** r/soccer match threads (Argentina/Algeria Messi hat trick thread, Norway vs Senegal Haaland goal clip thread, France/Mbappe thread, Portugal/Ronaldo thread)
- **Total labeled examples:** 288
- **Collection method:** Manual collection and annotation. Claude (claude.ai) was used to pre-label batches; every label was reviewed and corrected manually before being committed to the dataset.
- **Training dataset:** 160 examples (downsampled for balance — see below)

### Label Distribution (Full Dataset)

| Label | Count |
|---|---|
| analysis | 75 |
| reaction | 75 |
| humor | 75 |
| prediction | 63 |
| **Total** | **288** |

### Training Dataset (160 examples, used for fine-tuning)

| Label | Count |
|---|---|
| analysis | 40 |
| prediction | 40 |
| reaction | 40 |
| humor | 40 |

**Why downsampled:** The original dataset had Reaction at 80 examples (2x other labels). Training on the imbalanced set caused the model to collapse — predicting Reaction for every input regardless of content. Downsampling to 40 per label fixed this.

**Note on label merge:** An original 5-label taxonomy included a separate Opinion label (bare assertions without reasoning). This was merged into Reaction for model compatibility (the training notebook supported 4 labels). The Reaction definition was updated to cover both emotional responses and unsupported assertions.

### Difficult Labeling Examples

**Example 1:** *"mbappe might take the record this WC with how he's been scoring. Haaland probably won't be able to catch up."*
Possible: Prediction, Analysis → **Prediction.** The main point is a forecast; the scoring reference supports it rather than standing as independent analysis.

**Example 2:** *"It is ridiculous. But I do think tbf Senegal are a much better team than anyone Messi has played yet."*
Possible: Reaction, Analysis → **Analysis.** The comparative claim about opponent quality is reasoned judgment that could be fact-checked, not a bare assertion.

**Example 3:** *"Viking demands a blood sacrifice from France and Argentina"*
Possible: Humor, Reaction → **Humor.** The framing is entirely constructed for comedic effect; the literal reading makes no sense as a genuine response.

## Model

- **Base model:** `distilbert-base-uncased`
- **Task:** Sequence classification (4 labels)
- **Fine-tuning library:** HuggingFace Transformers + Trainer API

### Hyperparameter Decisions

| Parameter | Default | Final Value | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `num_train_epochs` | 3 | 20 | 3 epochs caused majority-class collapse on 112 training examples. More passes needed; `load_best_model_at_end=True` prevents overfitting by saving the best checkpoint. |
| `learning_rate` | 2e-5 | 5e-5 | Higher learning rate helped the model escape the majority-class trap on a small dataset. |
| `per_device_train_batch_size` | 16 | 16 | Unchanged — fits T4 GPU comfortably. |

## Evaluation

### Test Set Performance

| Model | Accuracy | Macro F1 |
|---|---|---|
| Zero-shot baseline (Groq llama-3.3-70b-versatile) | 0.750 | 0.58 |
| Fine-tuned DistilBERT | 0.625 | 0.62 |

### Per-Class Metrics

**Zero-shot Baseline:**

## Where Fine-Tuning Helped

Despite lower overall accuracy, fine-tuning produced meaningful improvements on two classes:

| Metric | Baseline | Fine-tuned | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prediction F1 | 0.67 | 0.80 | **+0.13** |
| Humor F1 | 0.18 | 0.44 | **+0.26** |
| Macro F1 | 0.58 | 0.62 | **+0.04** |

Fine-tuning learned community-specific Humor patterns (dry sarcasm, meme references, absurdist jokes about Mbappe being a "dictator") that the zero-shot LLM consistently missed. Prediction also improved — the model learned the community's specific phrasing of forecasts, including emotionally-toned ones the LLM classified as Reaction.

## Wrong Predictions Analysis

**Wrong Prediction 1 — Reaction misclassified as Analysis (confidence: 0.93)**

> *"Don't care what anyone says. Messi is still the best in the world. He could still easily play in Europe if he wanted to. Would just need a hard working team around him like he has with Argentina."*

**True:** reaction | **Predicted:** analysis

The model was fooled by evaluative football vocabulary — "best in the world", "play in Europe", "hard working team" are all phrases it associates with Analysis. But no reasoning supports the claim; it's a pure assertion. This reveals the model learned surface vocabulary rather than the presence or absence of supporting argument.

---

**Wrong Prediction 2 — Humor misclassified as Reaction (confidence: 0.95)**

> *"My favorite part of when he joined Miami is seeing him go into grocery stores without people swarming him. Nobody knew who he was lol."*

**True:** humor | **Predicted:** reaction

The joke is implied — Messi being unknown at a grocery store is absurd given his global fame. But the comment uses personal conversational tone ("My favorite part") that reads like a genuine emotional response. The model never learned to detect implied absurdity as a humor signal, defaulting to Reaction for anything personal and expressive.

---

**Wrong Prediction 3 — Humor misclassified as Prediction (confidence: 0.84)**

> *"I've seen enough, Morocco is the 2025 AFCON champion"*

**True:** humor | **Predicted:** prediction

A documented edge case from planning.md — sarcastic outcome claims. The comment is clearly a joke (making a definitive tournament prediction based on one Senegal performance) but structurally looks exactly like a Prediction. The model correctly identified the future-outcome structure but missed the sarcastic intent entirely.

## What the Model Learned vs What Was Intended

**What it learned:**
- Vocabulary patterns associated with each class (football evaluation words → Analysis, future tense → Prediction)
- Community-specific Humor phrasing — jokes about Mbappe being a "dictator", Haaland as a lab-designed striker, absurdist record comparisons
- Prediction phrasing — emotionally-toned forecasts the LLM missed

**What it failed to learn:**
- The difference between a bare assertion and a supported claim (Analysis vs Reaction boundary)
- Implied absurdity and dry sarcasm without explicit joke markers (Humor vs Reaction)
- Context-dependent jokes that require knowing the community's meme vocabulary

**Root cause of regression on overall accuracy:**
The zero-shot LLM (70B parameters, deep football pretraining) has a strong prior on football discourse. Fine-tuning a 66M parameter model on 112 training examples cannot overcome that general knowledge advantage on Analysis and Reaction. The fine-tuned model won where community-specific patterns matter (Humor, Prediction) and lost where world knowledge matters (Analysis, Reaction).

## Reflection

The classifier did not meet the original success threshold of 75% accuracy and 5-point improvement over baseline (baseline: 0.750, fine-tuned: 0.625, regression: -0.125). However it revealed something more interesting: **fine-tuning a small model on limited community data produces a more balanced classifier** (macro F1 0.58 → 0.62) even when overall accuracy doesn't improve.

The Reaction label is the weakest point — merging Opinion and Reaction created a noisy class covering two conceptually different things. A future version with separate Opinion and Reaction labels and 200+ examples per class would likely improve significantly, especially with the 5-label taxonomy the project originally designed.
